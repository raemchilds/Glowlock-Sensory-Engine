# üéõÔ∏è Glowlock Sensory Engine (GSE) üå≤‚ú®  
*A vibe dictionary for narrative worlds ‚Äî developed by Glowlock Labs.*

---

## üåø Overview  
The **Glowlock Sensory Engine (GSE)** is a machine learning‚Äìdriven ‚Äúvibe dictionary‚Äù that translates **sensory storytelling into data**.  

Each Glowlock realm ‚Äî **Moss Merry Way**, **Jingle Hoof**, **Dusk Hallows**, and beyond ‚Äî is encoded through five sensory dimensions: **taste, feel, color, sound, and smell**.  

Using text embeddings and similarity search, GSE allows users to describe a *vibe* (‚Äúbuttery candlelight with cinnamon wind‚Äù) and retrieve matching realms, generate art prompts, or visualize the emotional terrain of Glowlock‚Äôs universe.
