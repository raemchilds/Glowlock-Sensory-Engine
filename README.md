# 🎛️ Glowlock Sensory Engine (GSE) 🌲✨  
*A vibe dictionary for narrative worlds — by Glowlock Labs.*

---

## 🌿 Overview  
The **Glowlock Sensory Engine (GSE)** is a machine learning–driven “vibe dictionary” that translates sensory storytelling into structured data.  
Each Glowlock realm — **Moss Merry Way**, **Jingle Hoof**, **Dusk Hallows**, and beyond — is encoded through five sensory dimensions: **taste, feel, color, sound, and smell**.  

Using text embeddings and similarity search, GSE allows users to describe a vibe (“buttery candlelight with cinnamon wind”) and retrieve matching realms, generate art prompts, or visualize the emotional terrain of Glowlock’s universe.

## ✨ Features  
- Encode Glowlock realms (e.g., *Moss Merry Way*, *Jingle Hoof*, *Dusk Hallows*) into embeddings  
- Free-text “describe a vibe” search (cosine similarity)  
- Prompt scaffolds for art/video generation  
- Streamlit demo app + Jupyter notebook workflow
